/*Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

title: the title of the story
user: the user who submitted the story
score: the score of the story
timestamp: the time of the story
url: the link of the story*/


/*most popular Hacker News stories*/



SELECT title, score, url
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;

/*find the total score of all the stories*/

select sum(score)
from hacker_news;



/*Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores*/

select user, sum(score) as total
from hacker_news
group by user
having sum(score) > 200;

/*While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding.

The url of the video is:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ*/

select count(user), url
from hacker_news
where url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ';

/*Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:

_GitHub, Medium, or New York Times?_


First, categorize each story based on their source*/

select case 
when url like '%github.com%' then 'GitHub'
when url like '%Medium.com%' then 'Medium'
when url like '%nytimes.com%' then 'New York Times'
else 'Default'
end as 'Source',
count(*)
from hacker_news
group by 1;


/**/

SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;

/*Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using COUNT().

Also, GROUP BY the CASE statement.*/

SELECT timestamp,

GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;

/*Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but…

What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?

Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column:*/

SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) as 'hour', round(avg(score),0) as 'score', count(title) as 'n_of_stories'
FROM hacker_news
group by strftime('%H', timestamp)
order by avg(score) desc;
